# video-game-sales-project

## Dataset Overview

### The dataset, vgsales.csv, has been extracted from vgchartz.com and comprises various features related to video game sales. The key attributes include:

Rank: The overall sales ranking of the games.  
Name: The name of the games.  
Platform: The platform on which the games were released (e.g., PC, PS4).  
Year: The release year of the games.  
Genre: The genre of the games.  
Publisher: The publisher responsible for the games.  
NA_Sales: Sales in North America (in millions).  
EU_Sales: Sales in Europe (in millions).  
JP_Sales: Sales in Japan (in millions).  
Other_Sales: Sales in the rest of the world (in millions).  
Global_Sales: Total worldwide sales.

## Problem Statement

The task is to develop a Python script using Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and constructing suitable regression models. The focus is on testing hypotheses regarding the relationship between gaming platform, year, genre, publisher, and regional sales/global sales. The specific requirements for the assignment are as follows:

### 1. Jupyter Notebook Structure:

The notebook should be organized into five sections: Introduction, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Selection and Diagnostics, Findings and Interpretation, and Conclusion.

### 2. Linear Regression Models:

Implement at least three trained linear regression models to predict global sales of video games.

### 3. EDA:

Include code, outputs, and interpretation of the initial Exploratory Data Analysis.

### 4. ANOVA:

Apply ANOVA to test hypotheses, and provide clear interpretation of the results.

### 5. Code Comments:

Comment your code appropriately to enhance readability and understanding.

### 6. Error-Free Execution:

Ensure that the entire notebook can be executed without encountering any errors.

### 7. Markup Usage:

Utilize markup for explanations, write-ups, and interpretations throughout the notebook.
